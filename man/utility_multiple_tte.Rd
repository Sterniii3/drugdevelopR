}
\value{
The output of the the function \code{utility_multiple_tte()} is the expected utility of the program.
}
\description{
The utility function calculates the expected utility of our drug development program and is given as gains minus costs and depends on the parameters and the expected probability of a successful program.
The utility is in a further step maximized by the \code{optimal_multiple_tte()} function.
