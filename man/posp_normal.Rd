\arguments{
\item{kappa}{threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule; vector for both endpoints}

\item{n2}{total sample size for phase II; must be even number}

\item{alpha}{significance level}

\item{beta}{1-beta power for calculation of sample size for phase III}

\item{Delta1}{assumed true treatment effect for standardized difference in means}

\item{Delta2}{assumed true treatment effect for standardized difference in means}

\item{sigma1}{standard deviation of first endpoint}

\item{sigma2}{standard deviation of second endpoint}

\item{in1}{amount of information for Delta1 in terms of sample size}

\item{in2}{amount of information for Delta2 in terms of sample size}

\item{fixed}{choose if true treatment effects are fixed or random, if TRUE Delta1 is used as fixed effect}

\item{rho}{correlation between the two endpoints}
}
