\title{propability endpoint OS significant}
\usage{
os_tte(HRgo, n2, alpha, beta, hr1, hr2, id1, id2, fixed, rho)
}
\arguments{
\item{HRgo}{threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule;}

\item{n2}{total sample size for phase II; must be even number}

\item{alpha}{one- sided significance level}

\item{beta}{1-beta power for calculation of the number of events for phase III by Schoenfeld (1981) formula}

\item{hr1}{assumed true treatment effect on HR scale for treatment 1}

\item{hr2}{assumed true treatment effect on HR scale for treatment 2}

\item{id1}{amount of information for hr1 in terms of number of events}

\item{id2}{amount of information for hr2 in terms of number of events}

\item{fixed}{choose if true treatment effects are fixed or random, if TRUE hr1 is used as fixed effect}

\item{rho}{correlation between the two endpoints}

\item{ec}{control arm event rate for phase II and III}
}
