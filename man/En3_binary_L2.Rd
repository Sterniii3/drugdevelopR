\usage{
En3_binary_L2(RRgo, n2, Adj, alpha, beta, p0, w, p11, p12, in1, in2, fixed)
}
\arguments{
\item{RRgo}{threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule}

\item{n2}{total sample size for phase II; must be even number}

\item{Adj}{adjustment parameter}

\item{alpha}{significance level}

\item{beta}{1-beta power for calculation of sample size for phase III}

\item{p0}{assumed true rate of control group}

\item{w}{weight for mixture prior distribution}

\item{p11}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{p12}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{in1}{amount of information for p11 in terms of sample size}

\item{in2}{amount of information for p12 in terms of sample size}

\item{fixed}{choose if true treatment effects are fixed or random, if TRUE Delta1 is used as fixed effect}
}
\value{
the output of the the function En3_binary_L2 is the expexted number of participants in phase III
}
