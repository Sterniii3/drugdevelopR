\description{
The function \code{\link{optimal_multiple_tte}} of the drugdevelopR package enables planning of phase II/III drug development programs with optimal sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rules (Preussler et. al, 2019).
Fast computing is enabled by parallel programming.

\section{drugdevelopR functions}{

The drugdevelopR package provides the functions
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{optimal_tte}},
\item \code{\link{optimal_binary}} and
\item \code{\link{optimal_normal}}
}
to plan optimal phase II/III drug development programs with
\itemize{
\item time-to-event (treatment effect measured by hazard ratio (HR)),
\item binary (treatment effect measured by risk ratio (RR)) or
\item normally distributed (treatment effect measured by standardized difference in means (Delta))
}
endpoint, where the treatment effect is modelled by a \href{https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/prior/}{prior}. Optimal phase II/III drug development planning with fixed treatment effects can be done with the help of the R Shiny application \href{https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/basic/}{basic}. Extensions are
\itemize{
\item optimal planning of programs including methods for discounting of phase II results (function: \code{\link{optimal_bias}}, App: \href{https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/bias/}{bias}),
\item optimal planning of programs with several phase III trials (function: \code{\link{optimal_multitrial}}, App: \href{https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/multitrial/}{multitrial}) and
\item optimal planning of programs with multiple arms (function: \code{\link{optimal_multiarm}}, App: \href{https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/multiarm/}{multiarm}).
