\title{Expected probability to do third phase III trial}
\usage{
Epgo23_binary(RRgo, n2, p0, w, p11, p12, in1, in2)
}
\arguments{
\item{RRgo}{threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule}

\item{n2}{total sample size for phase II; must be even number}

\item{p0}{assumed true rate of control group}

\item{w}{weight for mixture prior distribution}

\item{p11}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{p12}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{in1}{amount of information for \code{p11} in terms of sample size}

\item{in2}{amount of information for \code{p12} in terms of sample size}
}
\value{
The output of the the function \code{Epgo23_binary()} is the probability to to a third phase III trial.
}
\description{
In the setting of Case 2: Strategy 2/2( + 1); at least two trials significant (and the
treatment effect of the other one at least showing in the same direction) this function calculates the probability that a third phase III trial is necessary.
}
\examples{
res <- Epgo23_binary(RRgo = 0.8, n2 = 50,  p0 = 0.3, w = 0.3,
                               p11 =  0.3, p12 = 0.5, in1 = 300, in2 = 600)
