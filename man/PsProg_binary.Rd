  alpha,
  beta,
  p0,

}
\arguments{
\item{RRgo}{threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule}

\item{n2}{total sample size for phase II; must be even number}

\item{alpha}{significance level}

\item{beta}{1-beta power for calculation of sample size for phase III}

\item{p0}{assumed true rate of control group}

\item{p11}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{p12}{assumed true rate of treatment group}

\item{step1}{lower boundary for effect size}

\item{step2}{upper boundary for effect size}

\item{strategy}{choose Strategy: 1 ("only best promising"), 2 ("all promising") or 3 (both)}

\item{case}{different cases: 1 ("nogo"), 21 (treatment 1 is promising, treatment 2 is not), 22 (treatment 2 is promising, treatment 1 is not), 31 (both treatments are promising, treatment 1 is better), 32 (both treatments are promising, treatment 2 is better)}
}
\value{
The function PsProg_binary() returns the probability of a successful program
}
\description{
Given we get the "go"-decision in phase II, this functions now calculates the probability that the results of the confirmatory trial (phase III) are significant, i.e. we have a statistically relevant positive effect of the treatment.
