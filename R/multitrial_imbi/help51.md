#### Summary
This shiny App is a tool for phase II/III drug development planning aiming to optimize the sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rule with respect to the maximal expected utility. The approach is based on a utility function taking into account, e.g., fixed and variable costs of the program (c<sub>02</sub>, c<sub>03</sub>, c<sub>2</sub> , c<sub>3</sub>), expected benefits after successful market launch (b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>), assumed true hazard rate (HR), and event rates in phase II and III (&xi;<sub>i</sub>, i=2,3). The considered drug development program consists of one phase II trial possibly followed (in case of a go-decision after phase II) by one, two, three or four phase III trials (depending on Strategy) of which at least one, two or three phase III trials need to be significant (depending on Case).
In particular, the considered cases and compared strategies are
