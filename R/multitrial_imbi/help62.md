For the detailed definition of the cases and strategies see Preussler et. al (2019). The graphic below illustrates the framework. In Case 2 for example, two significant trials are needed for approval ("two-trial efficacy criterion", US FDA (1995)). Here, Strategy 1<sub>&alpha;<sup>2</sup></sub> (one large trial with significance level &alpha;<sup>2</sup> may serve evidence on effectiveness instead of two trials, e.g. Fisher (1999)) is compared with Strategy 2<sub>&alpha;</sub>/2<sub>&alpha;</sub> and Strategy 2<sub>&alpha;</sub>/3<sub>&alpha;</sub>, where two and three trials are performed in case of a go decision, respectively. Therefore, two and three times the costs for phase III apply, respectively. For the definitions of program success and the effect size categories, the reader may be referred to Preussler et. al (2019) again.
