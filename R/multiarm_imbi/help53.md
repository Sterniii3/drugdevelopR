#### Values presented in table
* Strategy
* maxiaml expected utility (u)
* drug development planning characteristics: assumed true hazard rates (HR<sub>1</sub>, HR<sub>2</sub>), control arm event rate (e<sub>c</sub>)
* optimal threshold value for the decision rule to go to phase III (HR<sub>go</sub>)
* optimal total sample size for phase II (n<sub>2</sub>)
* total expected sample size for phase III (n<sub>3</sub>)
* total expected sample size in the program (n)
* maximal total expected sample size in the program (N)
* probability to go to phase III (p<sub>go</sub>)
* probability of a successful program (sProg)
* probability of a successful program with two arms in Phase III (sP2)
* probability of a successful program with three arms in Phase III (sP3)
* costs for phase II (K2)
* costs for phase III (K3)

and further input parameters. It should be noted, that "maximal" and "optimal" is with respect to the specified range of n<sub>2</sub> and HR<sub>go</sub>.
