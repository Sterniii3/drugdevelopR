#### Summary
This App is a tool for phase II/III drug development planning aiming to optimize the sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rule with respect to the maximal expected utility. The approach is based on a utility function taking into account, e.g., fixed and variable costs of the program (c<sub>02</sub>, c<sub>03</sub>, c<sub>2</sub> , c<sub>3</sub>), expected benefits after successful market launch (b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>), assumed true hazard rates (HR<sub>1</sub>, HR<sub>2</sub>), and control arm event rates in phase II and III (e<sub>c</sub>). The considered drug development program consists of one three-arm phase II trial possibly followed (in case of a go-decision after phase II) by a phase III trial.
In particular, two decision rule strategies are compared: in Strategy 1 only the best promising treatment of phase II goes to phase III, leading to a two-arm phase III trial. In Strategy 2 multiple treatments (if sufficiently promising) can go to phase III, resulting in a two- or three-arm phase III trial. Furthermore, a constraint on the total expected sample size in the trial can be specified (N).
