	As proposed by Götte et al. (2015), a mixture distribution which consists of the weighted sum of two normal distributions may be used as prior for the true treatment effect for the time-to-event endpoint $\theta = -\log(HR)$ ($HR$, hazard ratio):
	\[ \theta \sim w \cdot \mathcal{N}(-\log(HR_1),(4/i^d_1)) + (1-w) \cdot \mathcal{N}(-\log(HR_2),(4/i^d_2)), \]
	where $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ denotes the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The two normal distributions each depict a distribution for $\theta$ with the first one representing e.g. a strong and the second one e.g. a moderate treatment effect, whereby the denominators of the variances can be viewed as \textquotedblleft amount of information\textquotedblright{} about the treatment effect size in terms of numbers of events.\\
	
	To model the true treatment effect measured by the risk ratio $RR = p_1/p_0$, the control rate $p_0$ is assumed fixed and the rate of the treatment group $p_1$ may be modelled by the weighted sum of two normal distributions approximating binomial distributions
	\[p_1 \sim w \cdot \mathcal{N}\bigg(p_{1,1},\frac{p_{1,1}\cdot(1-p_{1,1})}{i^n_1}\bigg) + (1-w) \cdot \mathcal{N}\bigg(p_{1,2},\frac{p_{1,2}\cdot(1-p_{1,2})}{i^n_2}\bigg), \]
	where $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ denotes the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The two normal distributions each depict a distribution for $p_1$ with the first one representing e.g. a lower and the second one e.g. a higher rate in the treatment group, whereby the denominators of the variances can be viewed as \textquotedblleft amount of information\textquotedblright{} about the rate in terms of sample size.\\
	
	A prior distribution for the standardized true difference in means ($\Delta$) may be given by the weighted sum of two truncated normal distributions
	\[ \Delta \sim w \cdot \mathcal{N}^{t}_{[a, b]}(\Delta_2, 4/i^n_1) + (1-w) \cdot \mathcal{N}^{t}_{[a, b]}(\Delta_1, 4/i^n_2), \]
	where $\mathcal{N}^t_{[a,b]}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ denotes the truncated normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, truncated below $a$ and above $b$ (compare Rufibach et al., 2016). The two truncated normal distributions each depict a distribution for $\Delta$ with the first one representing e.g. a strong and the second one e.g. a moderate treatment effect, whereby the denominators of the variances can be viewed as \textquotedblleft amount of information\textquotedblright{} about the treatment effect size in terms of sample size.
