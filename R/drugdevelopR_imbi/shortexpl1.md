This shiny App is a tool for phase II/III drug development planning aiming to optimize the sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rule with respect to the maximal expected utility. The utility function takes into account, e.g., costs of the program, expected benefits after successful market launch and assumed true treatment effects.
