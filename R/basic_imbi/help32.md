#### Setting
We consider a drug development program with one exploratory phase II and one confirmatory phase III trial, which are performed independently with the same normally distributed primary endpoint and the same population. The phase II trial is a two-arm randomized trial followed by a decision rule, whether or not a phase III trial (RCT) is conducted. Program success is the joint event of going to phase III and declaring the treatment significant superior to the control. The treatment effect is measured by the standardized difference in means  &Delta;. We require that only promising treatments lead to a phase III trial: if the treatment effect estimate of phase II &Delta;&#770;<sub>2</sub> overshoots a predefined threshold value &kappa;, the treatment is declared to be promising. In case of a go decision, the calculation of the sample size for phase III is based on the promising treatment effect estimate of phase II and the z test is performed, which controls the type-I error by &alpha; and aims at 1- &beta; power. In case of program success, we assume that the amount of benefit depends on the value of the observed treatment effect in phase III. Orientated on a report of the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health products (IQWiG, 2016), three effect size categories (small, medium, large) and associated benefit categories (b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>) are defined by threshold values (e.g. 0, 0.5, 0.8 as proposed by Cohen (1988)) which have to be overshoot by the lower boundary of the two sided (1-&alpha;)-confidence interval of the standardized difference in means in phase III:
