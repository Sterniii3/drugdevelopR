### Optimal Designs for Phase II/III Drug Development Programs - Normally Distributed Endpoints


#### Summary
This shiny App is a tool for phase II/III drug development planning aiming to optimize the sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rule with respect to the maximal expected utility. The approach is based on a utility function taking into account, e.g., fixed and variable costs of the program (c<sub>02</sub>, c<sub>03</sub>, c<sub>2</sub> , c<sub>3</sub>), expected benefits after successful market launch (b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub> with respect to the treatment effect size observed in phase III) and assumed true standardized difference in means (&Delta;). It gives insights on how optimal design parameters (e.g. sample size for phase II and III (n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>), threshold value for the go/no-go decision rule &kappa;) and program characteristics (e.g. maximal expected utility, probability to go to phase III, probability of a successful program) change with for example varying expected benefit and assumptions about the true treatment effect &Delta;.
