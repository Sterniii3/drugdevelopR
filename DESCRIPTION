Description: The R package drugdevelopR is a tool to plan optimal sample size allocation and go/no-go decision rules for phase II/III drug development programs with time-to-event (measured by hazard ratio, HR), binary (measured by risk ratio, RR) or normally distributed (measured by standardized difference in means, Delta) endpoints when assuming fixed treatment effects or a prior distribution for the treatment effect. Optimal is in the sense of maximal expected utility, where the utility is calculated with the help of a utility function taking into account the costs and expected benefits of the program.
