- title: Bias adjustment
  desc: >
    As phase III is only conducted in case of promising phase II results,
    treatment effect estimates from phase II generally overestimate the
    treatment effect. The following methods supply bias adjustment strategies
    for optimal program planning.

- title: Multi-trial programs
  desc: >
    More and more often, regulatory authorities require more than one 
    confirmatory phase III study to have delivered a significant result. With
    the following methods, the planning of multi-trial programs can be 
    optimized.

- title: Multi-arm trials
  desc: >
    An efficient way of discovering effective treatments among a range of
    treatment choices is the conduct of multi-arm trials, which can be optimally
    planned using the following methods.

- title: Multiple endpoints
  desc: >
    In some trials, multiple endpoints may be of interest. Drug development
    programs with multiple endpoints can be optimized using the following
    methods.
